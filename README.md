# World_Weather_Analysis - Module 6

## Purpose
    The purpose of the World Weather Analysis was to integrate API's from Open Weather and Google to plot out a route accross a country given a criteria of set for specific temperatures in that city.  We also pulled in hotel information to map out where we would stay in each city on our route.  Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

### What we are creating
- Retrieve Weather Date
- Create a Customer Travel Destination Map
- Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Results
    I selected the temperatue range 65 - 85 degrees as the cities that I wished to visit.  From there I was given many cities to choose from and I chose four within the United States.  I started my route closest to me, Saint Anthony.  Then Google API was able to map out the optimal route for me to take.
